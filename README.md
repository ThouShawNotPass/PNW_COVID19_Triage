# National Testing Center Database
We need automated, scalable solutions to defeat COVID-19. That's why we're developing a web-based tool to help people determine whether a COVID-19 test is warranted and, if so, notify local medical professionals and facilitate testing at a nearby location. Current diagnosis efforts of COVID-19 are primarily focused on symptomatic and/or high risk individuals. We're currently working to direct high-risk individuals to newly-launched testing centers.
