# National Testing Center Database
We need automated, scalable solutions to defeat COVID-19. That's why we're developing a web-based tool to help people determine whether a COVID-19 test is warranted and, if so, notify local medical professionals and facilitate testing at a nearby location.

## How to help
Help our healthcare system fight COVID-19 by submitting the location of local testing centers to our Google Form listed on the website.

## Join our team
To roll out on a national scale, we need a vast team of developers to ensure that we are providing the most up-to-date and accurate information available.
