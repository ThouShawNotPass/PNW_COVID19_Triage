# National Testing Center Database
Current diagnosis efforts of COVID-19 are primarily focused on symptomatic and/or high risk individuals. We're currently working to direct high-risk individuals to newly-launched testing centers.

We need automated, scalable solutions to defeat COVID-19. That's why we're developing a web-based tool to help people determine whether a COVID-19 test is warranted and, if so, notify local medical professionals and facilitate testing at a nearby location.

## How to help
Help our healthcare system fight COVID-19 by submitting the location of local testing centers to our Google Form listed on the website.

## Join our team
To roll out on a national scale, we need a vast team of developers to ensure that we are providing the most up-to-date and accurate information available.

## Background
Public health and healthcare professionals are responding to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in more than 100 locations internationally, including in the United States. The virus has been named "SARS-CoV-2" and the disease it causes has been named "coronavirus disease 2019" (abbreviated "COVID-19").

# Steps to take

1. Complete a short survey

     This will include questions about yourself, including age, gender, recent travel history, current health status, and any known contact with others who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

2. For those deemed eligable for free testing with this program, schedule an appointment to go to a local facility for you to provide a biospecimen. 

     Based on your survey results, if you are identified as eligible for testing under this program for COVID-19, you will be asked to provide a biospecimen using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. You will be asked to schedule an appointment at a local facility.

3. Go to the testing facility at your assigned time for the test swab.

     At the test facility, you will need to bring a form of identification to confirm your identity prior to performing the swab collection. A trained healthcare professional will perform the swab collecton. This will be done by having you tilt your head back while a trained healthcare member inserts a sterile cotton swab into your nostril towards the back of your nose. The swab will be inserted to a depth about the distance from your outer nose to the outer opening of the ear. Once inserted, it will be held in place for a few seconds then slowly removed with midl rotation. This may cause temporary discomfort. Your sample will be tested by a clinical laboratory to determine if your sample is either positive or negative for SARS-CoV2.

4. Follow reccomended guidelines based on results of your lab testing.

     The lab results will be returned to you via email, text, phone call or through an app or web portal. Testing may take a few days and results will be returned to you when available.

## You don't qualify for testing through this program at this time

Please note that this is not a reccomendation of whether you should be tested. For additional information, please see the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html)

# Who is 'High Risk'

- 60 or older
- 3/4+ Different Medications
- Pregnant Women
- Caregiver of a high-risk person (?)

# CDC Guidelines on who to test
- If you have been in contact with someone who has been confirmed to have coronavirus, you are likely to be tested.
- If you have classic symptoms fever (100.4+), cough, and chest pressure then you are likely to be tested.
- DO NOT come into the clinic if you are sick WITHOUT CALLING AHEAD. Your healtcare provider will direct you a site for people who are infected or a site for people who have no symptoms.
